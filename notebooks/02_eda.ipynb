    "## 1. Overall Churn Challenge\n",
    "**26.54%** of customers have churned, representing a significant retention challenge that requires immediate strategic intervention.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Contract Type: The Primary Churn Driver\n",
    "\n",
    "Contract length shows the strongest correlation with customer retention:\n",

    "| Contract Type | Churn Rate | Risk Level |\n",
    "|---------------|------------|------------|\n",
    "| Month-to-month | **42.71%** | Critical |\n",
    "| One-year | **11.27%** | Moderate |\n",
    "| Two-year | **2.83%** | Low |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Finding**: Month-to-month customers are **15x more likely** to churn compared to two-year contract holders.\n",

    "**Business Impact**: Converting just 20% of month-to-month customers to annual contracts could reduce overall churn by ~6-8 percentage points.\n",
